# configs and more #
### Adapted and modified for OSX usage from dylnmc's config files ###
-- See dylnmc's dotfiles repository for a much more complete, well maintained, and informative experience with configuration files. 
-- If you are a Linux user, these files may not be for you. These configs are tailored for OSX and may be incompatible.

## Within this repository are configuration files for the following ##
- .bashrc              - bash profile (sourced for new bash shell)
- .vimrc               - vim profile (sourced when vim is started)
- .zshrc               - zsh profile (sourced for new zsh shell)

## Places to put the configs ##
- .bashrc
    * `ln -s` to "$HOME/.bashrc"
- .vimrc
    * `ln -s` to "$HOME/.vimrc"
- .zshrc
    * `ln -s` to "$HOME/.zshrc"

## Usages ##
- .bashrc
  * The bashrc file can be used for any terminal device - such as a native terminal or a terminal emulator - that is running a bash (or even an sh) shell. For more information, you can read the bash manual (`man bash` or https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)
- .vimrc
    * vim configuration file sourced when vim is run
- .zshrc
